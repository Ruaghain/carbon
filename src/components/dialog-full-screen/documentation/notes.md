# Designer Notes
- Useful to perform an action in context without navigating the user to a separate page.
- Whilst a standard Dialog componentâ€™s width might constrain what you can do, the full screen dialog uses the full width and height available.
- A good example could be importing a large volume of data, and checking for errors, in the context of an underlying Table of data.
