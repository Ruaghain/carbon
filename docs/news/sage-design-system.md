## What is The Sage Design System?

It's a framework of design elements, matched with a React development framework - specially crafted to help you build beautifully seamless and consistent experiences for your users.

As well as its practical advantages, the Sage Design System helps you design at scale - designers and developers have the same frame of reference, they can create and innovate faster, produce higher fidelity UI, and save rework.
